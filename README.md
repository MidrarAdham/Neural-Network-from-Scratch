# Neural-Network-from-Scratch

This is the repo for my YouTube video ["Coding a Neural Network from Scratch in Python"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcfCEt5GdLY). The goal is to code a neural net from scratch using just NumPy.

PS: The “html_files”-folder is just included in the repo so that I can embed the notebook into the respective [blog post](https://www.sebastian-mantey.com/code-blog/coding-a-neural-net-from-scratch-python) on my website.
